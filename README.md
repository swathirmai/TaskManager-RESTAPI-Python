# Task-Manager-using-FastAPI
Building a Task Manager APIs and Deploying on Azure

Task Manager: Create an API for managing tasks, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete tasks with proper authentication and authorization.

1. Project Setup:
   - Create a new FastAPI project or set up a virtual environment within an existing one.
   - Install the required dependencies, including FastAPI, a database connector (e.g., SQLAlchemy), and a token-based authentication library (e.g., OAuth2).

2. Data Models:
   - Define a data model for the "Task" entity. This model should include fields like task name, description, status (e.g., "completed," "in progress," "pending"), creation timestamp, and any other relevant properties.
   - Set up a database connection to store and retrieve tasks.

3. Authentication and Authorization:
   - Implement authentication using OAuth2 or another suitable method to protect your API endpoints.
   - Set up roles and permissions to control user access. For example, only the task owner or admin should be allowed to update or delete a task.

4. API Endpoints:
   - Create the necessary endpoints to handle CRUD operations for tasks (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   - Implement proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes to ensure RESTful API design.
   - Endpoints might include:
     - `GET /tasks`: Retrieve a list of all tasks.
     - `GET /tasks/{task_id}`: Retrieve a specific task by its ID.
     - `POST /tasks`: Create a new task.
     - `PUT /tasks/{task_id}`: Update an existing task.
     - `DELETE /tasks/{task_id}`: Delete a task.

5. Validation and Error Handling:
   - Implement input validation for creating and updating tasks to ensure that required fields are provided and data is in the correct format.
   - Handle potential errors gracefully and return appropriate error responses with meaningful messages.

6. User Management:
   - Implement user registration and login endpoints if you are not using an external authentication provider.
   - Associate tasks with specific users so that each user can only access their own tasks.

7. Testing:
   - Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the functionality and security of your API.
   - Include tests for both successful and error scenarios.

8. Documentation:
   - Generate API documentation using FastAPI's built-in support for OpenAPI and Swagger.
   - Ensure that the API documentation is clear and provides information on how to use each endpoint.

9. Deployment:
   - Deploy your FastAPI application to a server or cloud platform of your choice (e.g., Heroku, AWS, GCP).
   - Set up any necessary environment variables and configuration for the production environment.

10. Bonus Features (Optional):
   - Implement pagination for retrieving a limited number of tasks per request.
   - Add sorting and filtering options to allow users to retrieve tasks based on specific criteria.
   - Provide the ability to mark tasks as completed or in progress.
